# Roadmap

## Next (short-term)

- Feature request workflow + templates
- Improve UX around fatal errors (consistent quit path, error display)
- Vault operations: enforce basename uniqueness across all move/copy flows

## Later

- Richer search/filter UI
- Better SSH ergonomics (reattach, session UX)
- Optional path-based links (if basename uniqueness becomes limiting)
